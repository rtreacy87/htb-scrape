Each application is tailored to handle data from specific technologies or use cases, effectively acting as a pre-built knowledge package for that data. Apps can provide capabilities ranging from custom data inputs, custom visualizations, dashboards, alerts, reports, and more."

Many apps can be resource-intensive, so we must ensure our Splunk deployment is sized correctly to handle the additional workload. Further, it's also important to ensure we have the correct licenses for any premium apps, and that we are aware of the potential for increased license usage due to the added data inputs."
